You are analyzing code changes to determine what documentation updates are required.

## Context

This is a Global News Map project that displays breaking news on an interactive world map. The project has:
- **Backend API** (Python/FastAPI) in `service/src/api/`
- **Frontend UI** (React/Vite) in `ui/src/`
- **Documentation** that must stay synchronized with code changes:
  - User-facing docs in `ui/public/docs/` (served by the UI)
  - Technical/API docs in `docs/` (for developers)

## Your Task

Analyze the code changes above and determine:

1. **User-Facing Changes**: Identify changes that affect end users or API consumers
   - New/modified API endpoints
   - Changed request/response formats
   - New UI components or features
   - Modified configuration or deployment steps
   - Changes to data files that affect functionality

2. **Documentation Updates**: For each user-facing change, suggest specific updates to the appropriate documentation files
   - UI/UX changes → Update `ui/public/docs/how-to-use.md` (user-facing guide)
   - API changes → Update `docs/api-reference.md` (developer reference)
   - Deployment changes → Update `docs/deployment.md`
   - Be specific about which section needs updating
   - Provide the exact markdown content to add/update
   - Maintain the existing tone and format
   - Focus on clarity and completeness

## Response Format

Return your analysis as a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "userFacingChanges": [
    {
      "file": "service/src/api/routes.py",
      "type": "api_change",
      "description": "Added query parameter 'format' to /api/news endpoint"
    }
  ],
  "suggestedUpdates": [
    {
      "docFile": "ui/public/docs/how-to-use.md",
      "section": "## Reading Headlines",
      "reason": "New UI feature added to headline card",
      "suggestedContent": "When a headline is loaded, the sidebar displays:\n- City and country name\n- Headline title\n- Source and published time\n- Read full article link\n- Share button (new!)"
    }
  ]
}

## Important Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Reference exact section headers from the documentation
- **Be complete**: Include full markdown with formatting, code examples, and explanations
- **Be consistent**: Match the existing documentation style and tone
- **Be accurate**: Only suggest updates for actual changes, don't invent features
- **Focus on users**: Document what users need to know, not internal implementation details

If no user-facing changes are detected, return:
{
  "userFacingChanges": [],
  "suggestedUpdates": []
}

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanation.
